# COMMO PAD
A touchpad you can use on your PC or C64.

We all know the touchpad for the PC, pressure sensitive drawing tablet are all the rage now.
But there was a time when computer didn't even have mouses (or is it mice)...

In that time (somewhere around 1983) the koala pad was introduced. A pressure sensitve device allowing you to position your cursor accurately and easily. With a small pen in one hand and pressing buttons with the other hand you could make drawings on your C64 like a true pixel artist. Which is something that actually happened, although not many people were aware of it.
Most people like to play games, which used joysticks. And when themouse arrived people soon forgot about the koalapad.

Now wouldn't it be nice if you could make a koala pad from modern parts. Well... it's quite easy actually. So This is what I've done. It can also function like a 1351 mouse and like a simple joystick with autofire. If you want to use it on your PC, well, you can. Just plug it into the USB port of your PC and instantly you'll have a 2-button + scrollwheel capable mouse.

The device autodetects if it is connected via USB or to the joystick port of your C64. And you can easily configure it with one button press to make it act like a koala pad, joystick or 1351 mouse. This settings is stored in EEPROM so you only need to do this once.

All info about how to use it etc. is in the usermanual.
